// 1. Playerer is the base class. It is used to describe the user of this program;
// 2. Dealer is inherited from Player to describe the dealer, which is controlled by the computer.
// 3. SuperGambler is inherited from Player. In the analysis mode it can be used to simulate a player taking certain strategies.
